C++ polygon rendering using framebuffers. 
## Using Windows
To compile, execute and view the final image do the following:
```shell
g++ Color.cpp Framebuffer.cpp main.cpp Vertex2.cpp -o render.exe
```
Then run the executable
```shell
render.exe
```
This will generate the out.bmp on the same directory.
